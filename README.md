# Python-API-challenge

This exercise was a dive into using APIs and analyzing data obtained from them.  This was a really interesting and fun exercise, it was very fulfilling to see everything come together when the final map of all of the hotel locations came together.

WeatherPy

This exercise was really interesting to dive into.  It incorporated a lot of things we learned in class, including try/except statements, which are vital when working with for loops in the API environment.  It also was interesting to see how easy it was to work with the data.  I was able to easily make scatter plots which allowed us to calculate regression and to analyze the linear relationship between different factors.  Overall, this exercise seemed very intimidating at first, but after understanding how APIs worked and how to use the data, it became pretty simple.




VacationPy

This challenge was really interesting not only because we learned to put everything on a map, but also because it was the first exercise to take information from a previous standalone exercise.  I enjoyed seeing all the data represented on the map, and also liked the ability for the code to be used for any set of data.  I think the most important skill from this exercise that we practiced was the ability to narrow down data to fit criteria we wanted using the df.loc function.  I did appreciate that the starter code provided us with code to work with, and now that we finished the week learning about APIs, I am able to go ack in and completely understand what everything in the API request code is for.


Thank you for looking at my work!
